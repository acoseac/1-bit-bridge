# History — the box as an audio output

## The ALSA reader, the MPD client and `bridge output`

### ALSA scalar values use the value grammar, not the dotted-key grammar (2026-10-23, B516)

**Keep integers, reals and strings distinct; failed numeric conversions are
opaque strings, optional `=` is accepted, and comments/strings are bytes.
Never turn an unmodeled value into a resolved chain, lose a known softvol
or route warning, or weaken hooks/include guards at any token start.**

`lexPCM` distinguishes a definition's key from its value. In keys an
adjacent dot separates components (`ttable.0.0`); after whitespace a dot
starts a free-string value (`.5`). Within values dots belong to the scalar
(`0.5`, a library filename). Braces hold definitions and brackets hold
values; an iterative stack bounds nesting by the input, without recursion.
The key grammar stays restricted. Value tokens stop at ALSA's blanks or
`= , ; { } [ ] ' " \ #`. One optional `=` after a key precedes a scalar,
compound or array, including `pcm.x = { type = hw card = 2 }` and
PipeWire's `libs.native = /usr/lib/… ;`. A missing value or a repeated `=`
still refuses the file. Includes are not read, at keys, values or bracket
elements. The existing quote/backslash escape subset stays unchanged,
with either quote character delimiting a value. Comments and string values
are byte-oriented: Latin-1 text does not invalidate the file. NUL still
refuses it, and keys retain their restricted grammar.

The basis is alsa-lib v1.2.14 `src/conf.c`'s `get_freestring`, `parse_def`
and `parse_value`, with `safe_strtoll`/`safe_strtod`: a bare token beginning
with a digit or minus is tried as a base-zero signed integer, then a real,
consuming the entire token. **If both conversions fail, parse_value falls
through to STRING, never a parse error.** This corrects round 1's false
claim and refusal tests. `2chMaster`, `0.5garbage`, `-5dB`, `--5`, `1e`,
`1_000`, `0x`, `-`, `1e9999` and `1e-9999` are consumed as opaque strings.
Other bare words, including `.5`, paths and leading-plus words, are
strings; quoted numbers stay strings. Go-only numeric underscores and
binary/octal prefixes stay strings too. Hex and octal integers retain
their C numeric value; reals have their own token kind. Overflow and
underflow to zero fall back to strings. The session that ran the task
checked the reviews' reading of alsa-lib; the task, offline, fetched and
ran nothing of it, and libc/locale numeric edges remain unverified
(nonzero subnormals, NaN payloads and newer libc prefixes).

A real or newly admitted string is consumed but remains opaque for
resolution. A numeric `type` or `slave.pcm` is not a string reference, and
a negative integer card is not a card ID. Negative devices stay opaque
through the existing sign check; `subdevice` stays an unmodeled field.
Repeated types remain uncertain even when the second value is newly
accepted. Unknown fields keep their PCM opaque. `SampleStage` still names
the first known sample-changing stage through empty/plug stages, including
softvol with min/max dB and plug with a real transfer-table gain; it never
walks through that stage. The verdict is unchanged: these are `alsa_conf`
warnings beside format information, and bit exactness remains
`not_verifiable`. The Volumio capture still resolves through empty, plug
and hw. No wire shape changes.

Seven synthetic `testdata/asound-values/*.conf` files cover a real gain,
negative real, negative integer, PipeWire's assigned library path, dotted
library word, failed numeric conversions and Latin-1 bytes.
`TestPCMValueFixturesKeepResolutionAndStages` resolves the unaffected PCM
and exact chain and keeps the sample stage while refusing its chain;
`TestPCMValueFixturesKeepWarnings` loads those same files through the real
verdict. `TestPCMScalarKindsFollowALSA`,
`TestPCMValueKindsDoNotGrantResolution`, `TestPCMFailedNumbersAreOpaqueStrings`,
`TestPCMOptionalEquals`, `TestPCMByteStringsAndComments`,
`TestPCMValuesStillRefuseUnsafeFiles` and `TestPCMValueDelimiters` pin kinds,
opacity, assignments, byte strings, refusals and boundaries.
`FuzzPCMConfigValues` covers the tokens plus hooks and includes in key,
value and array positions; no PCM-file fuzz target preceded B516.

The original five fixtures failed against 3f805199's parser. Round 2's
numeric-string, optional-equals and byte-string tests fail against round
1's parser; the include and negative-device/subdevice guards already
held, with new mutation controls pinning them. The author's sandbox had
Go 1.27.1 while go.mod requires 1.27.2, so its own runs used a
scratch-only harness which omits unrelated sysfs/FIFO tests. In the
repository, on Go 1.27.2, `go vet`, `go test` and `-race` on
`internal/alsa` and `internal/signalpath` and `make docs-check` passed for
both rounds, and `FuzzPCMConfigValues` for round 2.
