## B514 — durable-writer evidence and advice (2026-10-23)

Three repeated A,B,A observations cannot establish that an overlay's upper
path reaches another filesystem: XFS inode totals and ZFS block totals can
change and return between reads. The writer retains three bounded retries;
upper {B,B,A} against overlay {A,A,A} is accepted on the third upper read.
A mismatch after all three stays ErrMediumUnknown and says inconclusive,
with advice to retry after filesystem activity settles and check the
service's mount namespace. This deliberately does not certify an XFS/ZFS
path whose relationship to the overlay cannot be established.

Linux reads st_dev with stat and renders its major:minor. The upper path's
own mount ID selects its mountinfo line, and the device must match before
that line's fstype is named as evidence. A decoy mount-point spelling is
ignored. Missing device, failed or absent mount ID, missing or malformed
line and device disagreement all remain unknown; the read error is wrapped.
This evidence identifies the filesystem visible here; it cannot authenticate
an upper backing hidden in another mount namespace. Existing agreement and
moving-totals checks, volatile refusals and nested-overlay depth bound stay.
The current inner mount's ID also selects nested overlay and FUSE lines.

ErrOverlayBind still matches ErrMediumUnknown, but describes unreachable
copy-up parents on a writable overlay subtree bind: persistent storage alone
does not mend its crash risk. No upper means no copy-up, so a read-only bind
passes the medium check and leaves EROFS to the write. syncAbove names every
failed directory, advises read access or leaving the overlay only for
fs.ErrPermission, and wraps other open errors without that advice. Its doc
names copyUpsFrom, which computes the directories to sync.

The platform-neutral tests exercise the mount-table evidence and totals
sequences without host proc/sys reads. Linux's adapter test uses only a temp
directory and compares its stat device with linuxStatfs's output. The engine
state machine, wire, and macOS/Windows mount readers are unchanged.
