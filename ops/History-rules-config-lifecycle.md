## B514 — durable-writer evidence and advice (2026-10-23)

Three repeated A,B,A observations cannot establish that an overlay's upper
path reaches another filesystem: XFS inode totals and ZFS block totals can
change and return between reads. The writer retains three bounded retries;
upper {B,B,A} against overlay {A,A,A} is accepted on the third upper read.
A mismatch after all three stays ErrMediumUnknown and says inconclusive,
with advice to retry after filesystem activity settles and check the
service's mount namespace. This deliberately does not certify an XFS/ZFS
path whose relationship to the overlay cannot be established.

Linux reads st_dev with stat and renders its major:minor. The upper path's
own mount ID, following the final symlink as statfs/stat do, authoritatively
selects its mountinfo line and that line's fstype is named as evidence.
A decoy mount-point spelling is ignored.
Device numbers are detail only, not a second identity gate: a btrfs
subvolume's st_dev can be its anonymous device while the line names the
superblock's device. A difference, or unavailable st_dev, does not make a
valid mount-ID-selected line inconclusive. Failed or absent mount ID and
missing or malformed lines leave the visible filesystem unknown; the read
error is wrapped. Round 2 corrects round 1's device-equality requirement.
This evidence identifies the filesystem visible here; it cannot authenticate
an upper backing hidden in another mount namespace. Existing agreement and
moving-totals checks, volatile refusals and nested-overlay depth bound stay.
The current inner mount's ID also selects nested overlay and FUSE lines.
Round 3 fixes a follow/no-follow mismatch at both upper-path lookups:
upperMountID resolves symlinks before asking mountIDOf, so an upperdir link
on ext4 to an XFS directory names XFS, whose totals were sampled, rather
than ext4. Resolution errors leave the evidence unavailable and retain their
cause. The same reader follows symlinked uppers reaching nested overlays or
FUSE, so their target's mountinfo line supplies the next upper or subtype.
The strict writer's no-follow mount reader and its Linux statx/fdinfo
implementations stay unchanged; only platformMedium selects the following
reader. Resolving a path and reading its identity are separate observations,
as are statfs/stat and the mount table; this does not authenticate backing
storage across a concurrent mount or link replacement.

ErrOverlayBind still matches ErrMediumUnknown, but describes unreachable
copy-up parents on a writable overlay subtree bind: persistent storage alone
does not mend its crash risk. No upper on the root's own mount (depth 0)
means no copy-up, so a read-only bind passes and leaves EROFS to the write.
At depth > 0, a read-only overlay is ErrMediumUnknown: the visible upper
path cannot be a writable overlay's upper layer. This includes a writable
bind whose upper path has been covered by a read-only overlay, or mapped
there in the service's mount namespace. Round 1's unconditional nil bypassed
the bind refusal and also accepted this impossible upper on an ordinary
writable overlay. Both shapes are fixture regressions in
TestMediumRefusesWhatDoesNotOutliveAReboot. syncAbove names every
failed directory, advises read access or leaving the overlay only for
fs.ErrPermission, and wraps other open errors without that advice. Its doc
names copyUpsFrom, which computes the directories to sync.

The platform-neutral tests exercise the mount-table evidence and totals
sequences without host proc/sys reads. TestMediumMismatchesNeedStableEvidence
includes btrfs with differing device numbers: it names btrfs and both
numbers, never claims a device mismatch defeats the mount ID, and still
answers ErrMediumUnknown for A,B,A. Linux's adapter test uses only a temp
directory and compares its stat device with linuxStatfs's output.
TestMediumFollowsASymlinkedUpper uses a real symlink with fixture ext4 and
target filesystem identities, covering XFS evidence, a nested overlay over
tmpfs, and fuse-overlayfs; it also checks that mountIDOf's Go wrapper still
names the link's own mount (through the stubbed platform reader). These fixtures run on macOS without real cross-filesystem
mounts or host proc/sys reads, and skip Windows' privileged symlink creation.
The engine state machine, wire, and macOS/Windows mount readers are unchanged.

## Live backup reads across rename (B470 PR 5a0, Round 9)

- **A live backup retries Windows sharing/access failures while opening files replaced by rename, with atomicwrite’s bounded, cancellable backoff; persistent errors still refuse it.** `Snapshot` reads a reservation while the engine may refill it asynchronously (`ahead` → `reserveWrite` → `writeReservation` → `WriteBytesDurable`). The writer closes its staged descriptor before rename; neither it nor `readLimited` leaks a reservation handle. A rename or a Windows scan-on-close handle can nevertheless conflict with the reader's open. Closing the test's engine before backup would remove the live-backup case, not fix it. Production currently refuses the player on Windows because directory fsync is unavailable; the Windows fixture supplies that barrier, but backup also reads files other live writers replace there.

  `atomicwrite.ReadWithRetryCtx` shares `RenameWithRetry`'s five-attempt schedule (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 ms; 750 ms total sleeping). Only Windows `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` and `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, including wrapped errors, retry. Other platforms and other errors return at once. The context interrupts backoff; exhausted errors keep their cause. Snapshot uses it for the live reservation, the freshly renamed UUID copy it rereads to stamp that reservation, and source stats/opens, including player UUID, tokens, config and account files. The copy still streams and commits once; no queue is backed up. A persistent unreadable reservation refuses backup, and only absence omits its mark.

  `TestSnapshotRetriesAHandleHeldAcrossRename` uses the existing rename seam to hold a real Windows staged-file handle that permits rename and denies read. It verifies the unprotected open returns the sharing violation, then releases the handle only when the snapshot's context is consulted for backoff: no timer can release it before the failed read. Reservation, source UUID, captured UUID and tokens cases require captured bytes and both floors. A read error on the captured UUID refuses backup after retries rather than silently omitting the mark; a malformed UUID still keeps the existing no-mark policy. `TestSnapshotRefusesAReservationStillHeldOrCancelled` keeps the handle through exhaustion or cancellation and requires the failed snapshot to be removed. `TestReadRetryWindowsErrors` checks both Windows codes; `TestReadRetryBoundsAndCancellation` checks the shared schedule and cancellation on every platform; `TestReadRetryKeepsPermanentErrors` keeps absence and malformed data immediate.
